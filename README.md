This is a texture pack for HalfRSS, which will convert the Kerbols System into our Real Solar System, but at half of the actual size. This makes it 5 times larger than KSP stock sizes.

Installation:
Unzip the RSS-Textures folder in the GameData folder in the archive to your KSP GameData folder, so you'll have KSP/GameData/RSS-Textures (and inside that lots of dds files). You can then manually replace some of the textures with different-resolution textures from the repository if you so choose.

Supreme thanks to dimonnomid and SpacedInvader and grayduster and Dr. Walther and KellanHiggins and KillAshley for incredible art for RSS. RSS would not look or perform the way it does (or have gotten released!) without their amazing contributions.
